# My Web Development Portfolio 

## A portfolio to showcase my projects 
 
This repository is where I built a website to show case my web application projects.

It is important for developers to have a one stop page that showcases some of the projects they built over the years, so that anybody looking to build a web app can go through their portfolio and see what they have built in the past and their contact information.
